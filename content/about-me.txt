I'm Michael Kalish, a Senior Applied Scientist at Uber working in AI Enablement, where I blend Machine Learning Engineering, Data Science, and Technical Program Management to drive cross-functional AI/automation projects. My work focuses on building and implementing RAG-based agentic solutions and scaling AI across global operations.

I hold a Master's in Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley (2025) and have a unique background that combines technical expertise in AI/ML with interdisciplinary studies in Philosophy, Psychology, and History from UCSB. This blend of technical and philosophical training shapes how I approach AI development and its broader implications.

Beyond my technical work, I've been a keynote speaker at Legal Innovators California on deploying AI solutions, and appeared as a co-star in Netflix's "You Are What You Eat" (Top 10 globally, January 2025). I'm passionate about making AI and data science accessible to everyone, having created Uber's "Data Science for Everyone Guide" with 2,100+ users.
