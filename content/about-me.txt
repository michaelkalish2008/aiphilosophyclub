I'm Michael Kalish, a Senior Applied Scientist at Uber specializing in AI Enablement, where I build RAG-based agentic solutions and scale AI across global operations. With a Master's in Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley and an interdisciplinary background in Philosophy, Psychology, and History from UCSB, I bridge technical AI implementation with philosophical inquiry. I've keynoted at Legal Innovators California, co-starred in Netflix's "You Are What You Eat" (Top 10 globally), and created Uber's "Data Science for Everyone Guide" with 2,100+ users.
