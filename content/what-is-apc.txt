AI Philosophy Club is an open community dedicated to building AI literacy—not just how to use AI tools, but how they were designed and how they function to simulate a situated someone. We explore the architecture and mechanisms of modern AI systems through the lens of continental philosophy, drawing primarily on Heidegger's "Being and Time" and Merleau-Ponty's "Phenomenology of Perception." By examining how Transformers, attention mechanisms, and agentic workflows embody philosophical principles about embodiment, understanding, and being-in-the-world, we develop a deeper comprehension of what AI systems actually do and what they fundamentally are.
