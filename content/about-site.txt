AI Philosophy Club explores the intersection of philosophy and modern AI systems architecture. Here I examine how architectural decisions in AI systems—from Transformer mechanisms to agentic workflows—embody philosophical principles about knowledge, reasoning, and intelligence. Through writing and discussion, I bridge the gap between technical implementation and philosophical inquiry, exploring how concepts like attention, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation reflect deeper questions about cognition and understanding.
